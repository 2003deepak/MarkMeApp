# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic notification system for a Flutter mobile application that displays real-time notifications from a backend service. The notification page will show different types of notifications (timetable updates, attendance confirmations, alerts) with appropriate icons, timestamps, and styling. The system will be designed to seamlessly integrate with backend APIs and provide a smooth user experience with proper state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view all my notifications in a centralized page, so that I can stay updated with important information about my classes and attendance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the notification page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all notifications
2. WHEN notifications are loaded THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN no notifications exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message
4. WHEN the notification list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show notifications in chronological order (newest first)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see different types of notifications with distinct visual indicators, so that I can quickly identify the importance and category of each notification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a timetable notification THEN the system SHALL show a calendar icon with blue styling
2. WHEN displaying an attendance confirmation THEN the system SHALL show a checkmark icon with green styling
3. WHEN displaying a critical alert THEN the system SHALL show a warning icon with orange/yellow styling
4. WHEN displaying any notification THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp showing when the notification was received
5. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL show appropriate background colors for different notification types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want notifications to be fetched automatically from the backend, so that I receive real-time updates without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notification page loads THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch notifications from the backend API
2. WHEN the app comes to foreground THEN the system SHALL refresh the notification list
3. WHEN new notifications are available THEN the system SHALL update the list automatically
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show cached notifications if available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to interact with notifications (mark as read, dismiss), so that I can manage my notification list effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on a notification THEN the system SHALL mark it as read
2. WHEN a notification is marked as read THEN the system SHALL update its visual state
3. WHEN a user swipes on a notification THEN the system SHALL provide dismiss/delete options
4. WHEN a notification is dismissed THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list and update the backend

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want clear API integration points with detailed documentation, so that I can easily connect the notification service to the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API calls THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code comments explaining request/response formats
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL handle all standard HTTP status codes appropriately
3. WHEN API integration is implemented THEN the system SHALL include error handling for network timeouts and server errors
4. WHEN the notification service is created THEN the system SHALL include detailed comments about expected backend endpoints and data structures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification page to be responsive and performant, so that I have a smooth experience when viewing my notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notification list contains many items THEN the system SHALL implement efficient scrolling with lazy loading
2. WHEN images or icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL cache them for better performance
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display content within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
4. WHEN scrolling through notifications THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification page to follow the app's design system and be accessible, so that it provides a consistent and inclusive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the notification page THEN the system SHALL follow the app's color scheme and typography
2. WHEN notifications are displayed THEN the system SHALL support accessibility features like screen readers
3. WHEN the page is viewed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for text readability
4. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes if applicable
